# CHIMERA
Welcome to the CHIMERA atmospheric retrieval code github!  What is CHIMERA? It stands for CaltecH Inverse ModEling and Retrieval Algorithms (yes, totally a backranym) originally developed back in the day when I was a grad student (in IDL no less). It has since morphed over the past ~7 years into something more functional.  What is uploaded here is the latest and "greatest" version.
