Hello!
This folder is currently empty.  GitHub doesn't like large files, which is exactly what opacities are!
To get around this you will have to download the requisite files from
a dropbox folder. After pulling CHIMERA (maintaining the directory tree)
go to: 

https://www.dropbox.com/sh/o4p3f8ukpfl0wg6/AADBeGuOfFLo38MGWZ8oFDX2a?dl=0

Download all of the *.h5 files and the subfolders CHEM and MIE_COEFFS into
the ABSCOEFF_CK folder on your computer.  It may take a minute....
Once that is done, you should be set to run the jupyter notebooks!!
